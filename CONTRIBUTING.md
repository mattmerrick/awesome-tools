# Contributing to FreeStuff.dev

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Adding new resources
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Adding New Resources

To add a new resource, you have two options:

### 1. Submit via GitHub Pull Request

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Open the `src/data/resources.json` file.
3. Add a new entry following this format:   ```json
   {
     "name": "Product Name",
     "description": "A short description of the product",
     "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
     "url": "https://product-url.com"
   }   ```
4. Ensure all required fields (name, description, tags, and url) are filled.
5. Create a pull request with your changes.

### 2. Submit via Web Form

If you're not comfortable with GitHub, you can use our web form to submit a new resource. Visit [our submission page](https://yourdomain.com/submit) to add a new resource.

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
